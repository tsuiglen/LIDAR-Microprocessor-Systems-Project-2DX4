# LIDAR-Microprocessor-Systems-Project-2DX4
This device is an embedded spatial measurement system that utilizes time-of-flight to measure distance 360 degrees along the Y-Z plane. The stored data can be used to construct a 3D model of the samples for presentation purposes using applications on a personal computer. This system is similar to Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) equipment...
